# inetask2

These two task brought me to learn many new concept such as Docker, Wordpress, Amazon AWS (API Gateway, DynamoDB, AWS Amplifier Console, IAM Manager and many more things). These concepts were totally new to me and I haven't done work on these topic.

Thank you for sending these assignment tasks to show this side for computer science (Cloud Development).

Even though, I couldn't done much better in this task, the best I could is learn these new things from scratch and tried to to do some work that is in this GitHub Repository.

I have installed Docker Desktop, Wordpress and XAMPP(Web host) for working but got some error that I couldn't resolve in the given time and move toward the second task.

In this task, I have taken help from Amazon AWS helping guide to make web application and learnt the steps involved it and some basic terminologies, how these platforms(Lambda, DynaoDB,Amplifier Console,API Gateway) are connected to each other.

I am still lagging behind on some topic such as Vulnerabilities and connections, also S3 concept and trying to research more on this.

I got an error on publishing the website which I think might be possible to work upon after some more research and getting through all the codes I have written.

At last, Thanks for giving me this opportunity to work upon and learn, even though I couldn't complete the task successfully, I am delighted that I tried it and learn so many new basic thing in this field as well.

Thank you
